Audio::Ecasound

DESCRIPTION
       Audio::Ecasound provides perl bindings to the ecasound
       control interface of the ecasound program.  You can use
       perl to automate or interact with ecasound so you don't
       have to turn you back on the adoring masses packed into
       Wembly Stadium.

       Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack
       audio processing.  It can be used for audio playback,
       recording, format conversions, effects processing, mixing
       and as a LADSPA plugin host.  Version >= 2.0.1 must be
       installed to use this package.  the SEE ALSO entry
       elsewhere in this document for more info.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL

       If your perl wasn't built with -Dusethreads or
       -D_REENTRANT you will be prompted whether to continue with
       the install.  It's in your hands... See the THREADING NOTE
       entry elsewhere in this document

        make
        make test
        make install


THREADING NOTE
       The ecasoundc library uses pthreads so will probably only
       work if your perl was compiled with threading enabled,
       check with:

        % perl -V:usethreads

       You are welcome to try using the module with non-threaded
       perls (perhaps -D_REENTRANT alone would work) but expect
       problems.  On my Linux box it hangs during intialization
       without threads but if can be made to work let me know.
